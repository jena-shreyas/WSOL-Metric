1) NameError: name '_C' is not defined
Sol : factory resetting the runtime and then rerunning the import without any changes

2) nvcc --version works but nvidia-smi gives "not installed"
Sol : 

	Run the following commands to remove everything NVIDIA, and then install the NVIDIA drivers : 

	    1. sudo apt install --reinstall gcc
 	    2. sudo apt-get --purge -y remove 'nvidia*'
	    3. sudo apt install nvidia-driver-525 (or any other new version) 
	    4. sudo reboot
	    
	Next, you'll see nvidia-smi work but nvcc --version stops working. This is bcoz nvidia-cuda-toolkit was deleted, which is needed for CUDA to run.
	
	Now, install nvidia-cuda-toolkit using :
	
	    sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
	    
	Hopefully, both nvidia-smi and nvcc --version will work after that.
